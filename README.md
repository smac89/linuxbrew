# Note
**If you use [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) in conjunction with any other plugin manager (for example, the ones listed above), make sure to load this plugin first, before loading _oh-my-zsh_, otherwise the completions will not work. See this [issue](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/5651) posted on _oh-my-zsh_ issues page for the reason why.**
